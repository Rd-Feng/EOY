### A professional networking platform

Our mission is to help expand user's professional network by generating
a common topic of discussion.

We begin engineers and other professionals together by offering providing
articles sourced using the HackerNews API. These articles serve as an
icebreaker. Users can read, comment, and connect with other users reading the
articles. New articles are replenished daily, and there is an option to
bookmark favorite articles. Users will also be able to share their contact information
(Github, Linkedin, Twitter, etc) on our platform to help expand their network.

## Usage
1. Clone repo and run 'npm install` to install any dependencies
2. Run both react application and api
3. Application runs on port 3000
NOTE: Replace keys with your own google API keys
